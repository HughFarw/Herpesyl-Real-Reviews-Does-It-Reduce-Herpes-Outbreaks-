## What Is Herpesyl?
[Herpesyl Reviews](https://dailynutraboost.com/herpesyl-reviews/) is a nutritional supplement that claims to support the body's defense against herpes viruses. It is said to be formulated using 100% natural ingredients with antiviral and immune-boosting properties.

## How Does Herpesyl Work?
According to its creators, Herpesyl works in three key stages:

1.	Nutrient Absorption and Brain Detoxification: Ingredients like Graviola and Shitake mushrooms are said to help flush toxins and viral remnants from the brain.

2.	Virus Disruption: The formula includes antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds like burdock root and red raspberry, believed to weaken the herpes virus's grip on nerve cells.

3.	Immunity Reinforcement: A blend of vitamins such as Vitamin C, E, and selenium is included to strengthen the immune system and reduce the risk of future outbreaks.

It's important to note that while these claims sound promising, they haven't been evaluated by the FDA, and Herpesyl is not a substitute for prescription antiviral medication.
